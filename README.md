# About Me

I am currently a **Microsoft Employee**, this is just my personal repository of Azure Code. This repo is focused on [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/overview?view=azps-1.4.0). I have other repos focused on other scripting languages like
[az cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest), [Terrafrom](https://www.terraform.io) and [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/) calls. This collection will grow over time and if you are not seeing it yet, it simply means I am testing, I try to get the code/samples as accurate as possible. </br>

I am working on a tree change for this repo to hopefully make it easier to find what you are looking for. I will be working with the following idea, top folder will be a technology like Networking and then sub folders based upon scripting or coding languages where applicable, for example. This will take some time so please be patient wih me.</br>

**tf – Terraform**</br>

```bash
README.MD
├── service/technology
│   └── tf
│       └── file.azcli (if needed)
│       └── file.tf (if needed)
```

* Example file structure 1 - storageAccount

```bash
├── storageAccount
│   └── tf
│       └── createstorageaccount.azcli
│       └── main.tf
```
